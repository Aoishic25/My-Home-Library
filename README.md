# My-Home-Library
This is a website I have created using NodeJS, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. It uses an open-source DBMS software called phpmyadmin to store and transact data. The file app.js serves as the main configuration of the website.

As a lover of books with a budding interest in Anime/manga, Movies, TV shows, and video games, I created this website solely out of interest, using the coding skills I acquired in my second year. But later, it developed into a personal project for me to upgrade and edit as per my wishes. Just recently, I succeeded in storing names and Latin terms, along with displaying all the data I have entered.
